 o Minor features (onion services):
   - Remove initial descriptor upload delay for ephemeral onion services.
     Previously one had to wait useless 30 seconds before upload.
     If descriptor becomes outdated after initial upload, it will be awaited
     for 3s to stabilize. If descriptor changes too soon after this (< 30s),
     a warning about unreliable network will be shown. Closes ticket 20082.

 o Major bugfixes (onion services):
   - Fix code that claimed to introduce random initial descriptor upload
     delay to hinder linkability of services, but never actually worked.
     Now there is a random delay up to 5m for each on-disk service.
     Fixes bug 12500; bugfix on 0.0.9pre6.
