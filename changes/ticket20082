 o Minor features (onion services):
   - Remove initial descriptor upload delay for onion services. Previously one
     had to wait useless 30 seconds before upload. If descriptor becomes outdated
     after initial upload, it will be awaited for 3s to stabilize. If descriptor
     changes too soon after this (< 30s), a warning about unreliable network
     will be shown. Closes ticket 20082.

 o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
   - Remove code that claimed to introduce random initial descriptor upload
     delay, but never actually worked. Fixes bug 12500; bugfix on 0.0.9pre6.
