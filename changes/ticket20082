 o Major features, refactoring (onion services):
   - Remove initial descriptor upload delay for onion services. Previously one
     had to wait useless 30 seconds before upload. Also it could make an onion
     service be unavailable to clients if they try to access the onion service
     before a descriptor of which got uploaded. If descriptor becomes outdated
     after initial upload, it will be awaited for 3s to stabilize. If descriptor
     changes to soon after this (< 30s) a warning about unreliable network
     will be shown. Closes ticket 20082; feature on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
